&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caring piggies and sows who live together in a farrowing crate is difficult because
the number of farm keepers is not enough to take care all of them. A lot of manpower and time
are required for such job. To reduce the workload and increase the performance of piggy care in
farrowing crate, vision-based piggy care system is designed and developed for monitoring
sleeping behavior of them. The proposed system will detect feature points in image sequences.
Only features of which descriptors are similar to representative piggiesâ€™ features in the model will
be tracked. The position of piggy in each frame will be analyzed to determine where and how
long the piggy has slept. When the piggy has slept in an inappropriate area for a certain period,
the system will trigger an alert in order to notify the farm keeper. The system is designed such
that the farm keeper can mark the improper sleeping area. The sleeping time interval in such area,
which is used as the condition for triggering the alarm, can also be selected by the user.
According to experimental results, the system can trigger the alert correctly without false alarm.
